# MODULE 1: AI Fundamentals
## Understanding the Landscape & Selecting Your Tools

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how modern AI tools actually work (without the hype)
- Evaluate AI tools objectively for your specific needs
- Build a personal AI toolkit that complements your workflow
- Avoid common pitfalls that waste time and money

---

## Lesson 1.1: How AI Tools Actually Work

### The Mental Model You Need

Modern AI language models are sophisticated pattern-matching systems trained on vast amounts of human-generated text. Understanding this helps you:

1. **Know what AI excels at:**
   - Pattern recognition and replication
   - Synthesis across large information sets
   - Generating variations and alternatives
   - Translating between formats and contexts
   - Maintaining consistency with given examples

2. **Know what AI struggles with:**
   - Truly novel creative leaps
   - Recent information (knowledge cutoffs)
   - Mathematical reasoning (improving but imperfect)
   - Maintaining truth when confident errors sound plausible
   - Understanding your unstated context

### Key Concept: The Stochastic Parrot vs. Reasoning Spectrum

AI tools exist on a spectrum:
- **Pure generation**: Predicting likely next tokens (words)
- **Guided generation**: Following instructions while generating
- **Emergent reasoning**: Complex behaviors emerging from scale

Today's best models show emergent reasoning, but treating outputs as requiring verification keeps you accurate.

### Exercise 1.1: Test the Boundaries

Try these prompts with your AI tool of choice and note where it excels vs. struggles:

1. "What happened in the news yesterday?" (Recency test)
2. "Calculate 7,843 x 9,271" (Math test - verify with calculator)
3. "Write a poem about loss that would make a therapist cry" (Emotional depth test)
4. "What would my manager think about this idea?" (Context it doesn't have)
5. "Generate 10 genuinely original startup ideas" (Novelty test)

**Document your findings**: What patterns do you notice?

## Lesson 1.3: Building Your AI Toolkit

### The Core Stack Framework

**Tier 1: Your Primary AI (Pick One)**
This is your default, go-to AI for general tasks.

Selection criteria:
- Quality of outputs for your main use cases
- Interface you enjoy using
- Price/value for your usage level
- Integration with your existing tools

Recommendation: Start with Claude or ChatGPT Plus. Both offer excellent quality; Claude tends toward more careful, nuanced responses while ChatGPT has broader plugin ecosystem.

**Tier 2: Specialized Tools (2-3 Max)**
Tools that do one thing better than your primary AI.

Common combinations:
- Primary (Claude) + Perplexity (research) + Midjourney (images)
- Primary (ChatGPT) + GitHub Copilot (coding) + Descript (video)

**Tier 3: Integration Layer**
Tools that connect AI to your workflow:
- Zapier (automation)
- Make (complex automations)
- Browser extensions (quick access)
- API access (custom solutions)

### The "Good Enough" Principle

Most people over-tool with AI. Signs you have too many tools:
- You forget which tool to use for which task
- You're paying for tools you rarely use
- You spend more time tool-switching than working

**Rule of thumb**: If you're not using a tool weekly, eliminate it.

### Exercise 1.3: Design Your Stack

Using the Core Stack Framework, design your ideal AI toolkit:

**My Tier 1 Primary AI:**
- Tool: ________________
- Why: ________________

**My Tier 2 Specialists:**
- Tool 1: ________________ for ________________
- Tool 2: ________________ for ________________

**My Tier 3 Integrations:**
- ________________

**Estimated monthly cost**: $________________

## Lesson 1.4: Understanding Capabilities & Limitations

### What Modern AI Does Well

**1. First Draft Generation**
AI excels at overcoming the blank page. Use it to generate starting points you refine, not final products.

**2. Transformation & Translation**
- Format conversion (notes → email, data → story)
- Tone adjustment (casual → formal)
- Audience adaptation (technical → simple)
- Language translation with context

**3. Analysis & Synthesis**
- Pattern identification in large texts
- Summarization with specific focus
- Comparison across multiple sources
- Extraction of key information

**4. Brainstorming & Ideation**
- Volume of ideas (quantity enables quality)
- Different perspectives ("think like a CFO...")
- Combinations and variations
- Edge case identification

**5. Explanation & Teaching**
- Concept breakdowns at any level
- Analogies to familiar domains
- Step-by-step walkthroughs
- Custom examples for your context

### What Requires Verification

**1. Facts and Figures**
AI confidently produces incorrect statistics. Always verify:
- Numbers and percentages
- Dates and historical claims
- Names and attributions
- Recent events

**2. Technical Accuracy**
- Code may have subtle bugs (test it)
- Legal/medical advice (consult professionals)
- Best practices (may be outdated)

**3. Logical Reasoning**
- Complex multi-step logic
- Mathematical proofs
- Causation (AI conflates with correlation)

### The 80/20 Rule for AI

AI typically gets you 80% of the way in 20% of the time. Your job is:
- Providing the right context (input quality)
- Evaluating the output (human judgment)
- Adding the final 20% (refinement)

Trying to get AI to produce 100% final output wastes more time than accepting 80% and refining.

### Exercise 1.4: Capability Mapping

For your three most common work tasks, identify:

Task 1: ________________
- What AI can do: ________________
- What I must verify: ________________
- What I add: ________________

(Repeat for Tasks 2 and 3)

## Lesson 2.1: The Anatomy of an Effective Prompt

### The Core Components

Every effective prompt contains some combination of:

**1. Context (Who/What/Where)**
Background information the AI needs to respond appropriately.

```
Bad: "Write a welcome email."

Good: "I run a SaaS project management tool for remote teams.
A new user just signed up after a 14-day trial. They're a
project manager at a mid-size marketing agency."
```

**2. Task (What to do)**
Clear, specific instruction on what you need.

```
Bad: "Help me with my presentation."

Good: "Create a 10-slide outline for a presentation
on Q3 results to the board of directors."
```

**3. Format (How to deliver)**
Explicit description of desired output structure.

```
Bad: "Give me some ideas."

Good: "List 10 ideas, each with a one-sentence description
and a difficulty rating (easy/medium/hard)."
```

**4. Tone/Style (Voice)**
How you want the content to sound.

```
Bad: "Make it good."

Good: "Write in a conversational but professional tone,
similar to Harvard Business Review articles."
```

**5. Constraints (Boundaries)**
What to avoid, limits, requirements.

```
"Keep it under 200 words. Avoid technical jargon.
Don't mention competitor products by name."
```

### The Prompt Quality Spectrum

**Level 1 - Vague**: "Help me write something."
- Output: Generic, requires heavy editing
- Time waste: High

**Level 2 - Basic**: "Write an email asking for a raise."
- Output: Usable but generic
- Time waste: Medium

**Level 3 - Specific**: "Write an email to my manager Sarah asking for a 15% raise. I've been at the company 2 years, exceeded my targets by 30% last quarter, and recently took on the Jenkins account. Tone: confident but not demanding. Length: 150-200 words."
- Output: Ready to customize
- Time waste: Low

**Level 4 - Comprehensive**: [Uses full framework like RISEN]
- Output: Near-final quality
- Time waste: Minimal

**The math**: A Level 4 prompt takes 2 minutes longer to write but saves 15 minutes of editing. Always invest in prompt quality.

### Exercise 2.1: Prompt Upgrade

Take this basic prompt and upgrade it to Level 4:

Original: "Write a LinkedIn post about AI."

Your upgraded version:
(Include context, specific task, format, tone, and constraints)

---

## Lesson 2.2: Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Technique 1: Role Assignment

AI performs better when given a specific expert persona.

```
"You are a senior financial analyst with 15 years of experience
at Goldman Sachs, specializing in SaaS company valuations."

vs.

"Help me understand valuations."
```

**Power move**: Combine roles for unique perspectives.
```
"You are a clinical psychologist who also has an MBA and
10 years of management consulting experience."
```

### Technique 2: Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples of what you want.

```
"Rewrite these headlines to be more engaging:

Original: Company Reports Q3 Earnings
Rewritten: Inside the Numbers: How Q3 Revealed Our Next Growth Engine

Original: New Feature Released
Rewritten: The Feature Our Users Have Been Requesting for 2 Years Is Finally Here

Original: Annual Report Published
Rewritten: [Your turn - rewrite this following the pattern above]"
```

### Technique 3: Chain of Thought

Ask AI to show its reasoning process.

```
"Analyze this business decision. Think through it step by step:
1. First, identify the key factors to consider
2. Then, evaluate each factor
3. Consider potential risks
4. Finally, provide a recommendation

The decision: [Your decision here]"
```

### Technique 4: Constraint Stacking

Layer constraints for precise output.

```
"Write a product description that:
- Is exactly 50 words (not 49, not 51)
- Includes the words 'transform' and 'effortless'
- Contains no superlatives (no 'best,' 'greatest,' etc.)
- Uses second person ('you' not 'users')
- Has a reading level appropriate for 8th grade
- Ends with a question"
```

### Technique 5: Iterative Refinement

Build on previous outputs.

```
Round 1: "Write a tagline for a meditation app."
Round 2: "Give me 10 variations, some funny, some serious."
Round 3: "Combine the playfulness of #3 with the clarity of #7."
Round 4: "Now make it exactly 5 words."
```

### Technique 6: Perspective Shifting

Get multiple viewpoints.

```
"Analyze this marketing strategy from three perspectives:
1. A skeptical CFO concerned about ROI
2. A creative director focused on brand
3. A data analyst who only trusts numbers

Then synthesize their viewpoints into a balanced assessment."
```

### Technique 7: Negative Prompting

Tell AI what NOT to do.

```
"Write a sales email that:
- Does NOT use the words 'revolutionary,' 'game-changing,' or 'unique'
- Does NOT start with 'I hope this email finds you well'
- Does NOT include more than one call-to-action
- Does NOT exceed 100 words
- Does NOT use more than one exclamation point"
```

### Exercise 2.2: Technique Application

Take a task you regularly do and apply THREE of the above techniques to create a prompt for it.

Your task: ________________

Your prompt using techniques: ________________

**The "Edit My Work" Prompt:**
```
"I'm going to share a piece of my writing. Please:
1. Identify the three biggest weaknesses
2. Suggest specific improvements for each
3. Show a rewritten version of the weakest paragraph
4. Point out what's working well (so I keep doing it)

Don't rewrite everything - I want to learn, not just get output.

[Your writing here]"
```

**The "Match This Voice" Prompt:**
```
"I want you to write in my voice. Here are three examples
of my writing:

Example 1: [200+ words]
Example 2: [200+ words]
Example 3: [200+ words]

Now, write a [piece type] about [topic] in this same voice.
Mirror my sentence patterns, vocabulary choices, and rhythm."
```

### Use Case: Research & Analysis

**The "Executive Summary" Prompt:**
```
"I'm going to paste a long document. Create an executive summary that:
- Opens with the single most important insight
- Covers key points in 5-7 bullets
- Notes any decisions that need to be made
- Highlights risks or concerns
- Takes no more than 2 minutes to read

Document: [paste]"
```

**The "Compare & Contrast" Prompt:**
```
"Compare these two options across these dimensions:
- Cost (short-term and long-term)
- Implementation complexity
- Risk profile
- Alignment with our goals: [state goals]

Present as a table, then provide a recommendation with
confidence level (high/medium/low) and key caveats."
```

### Use Case: Brainstorming & Ideation

**The "Quantity First" Prompt:**
```
"Generate 30 ideas for [topic]. Don't self-censor - include
wild ideas, practical ideas, and everything in between.
Number them. After listing all 30, identify the 3 most
promising and explain why."
```

**The "Cross-Pollination" Prompt:**
```
"Take the core mechanism from [Thing A in Industry A] and
apply it to [Industry B]. Generate 5 specific product
or service ideas that emerge from this combination."
```

### Use Case: Problem Solving

**The "Rubber Duck" Prompt:**
```
"I'm stuck on a problem. I'm going to explain it to you, and I
want you to:
1. Summarize it back to confirm understanding
2. Ask 3 clarifying questions
3. Identify assumptions I might be making
4. Suggest 3 different frames for looking at the problem

Problem: [explain]"
```

**The "Pre-Mortem" Prompt:**
```
"I'm about to [decision/action]. Imagine it's 6 months later
and it has failed spectacularly. Write a detailed post-mortem
explaining what went wrong. Be specific about failure modes
I might not be considering."
```

### Exercise 2.3: Use Case Library

Create prompts for your three most common use cases using
the templates above as inspiration:

## Lesson 2.4: Debugging Prompts

### Common Prompt Failures & Fixes

**Problem 1: Output too generic**
```
Symptom: "Write a blog post" → bland, could be written by anyone
Fix: Add specific context, voice examples, unique angle

Before: "Write a blog post about productivity."
After: "Write a blog post about productivity for burned-out
startup founders. Draw on the philosophy of essentialism.
Include a specific example from Y Combinator companies.
Voice: Paul Graham meets Naval Ravikant."
```

**Problem 2: Output too long**
```
Symptom: Asked for a summary, got 1000 words
Fix: Explicit word/sentence limits plus "prioritize ruthlessly"

Before: "Summarize this article."
After: "Summarize in exactly 3 sentences. Each sentence
should convey a distinct key point. Prioritize ruthlessly -
omit interesting-but-not-essential details."
```

**Problem 3: Wrong tone**
```
Symptom: Asked for professional, got corporate-speak
Fix: Provide examples of target tone, specify what to avoid

Before: "Write professionally."
After: "Write in the style of Stripe's documentation -
professional but warm, precise but not stiff. Avoid:
corporate jargon, passive voice, 'leverage' and 'synergy'."
```

**Problem 4: Misunderstanding the task**
```
Symptom: AI did something different than intended
Fix: Break into explicit steps, confirm understanding first

Before: "Help me improve this process."
After: "I'll describe a process. First, confirm your understanding
by restating it. Then identify the 3 biggest inefficiencies.
Wait for my confirmation before suggesting improvements."
```

**Problem 5: Inconsistent outputs**
```
Symptom: Same prompt, wildly different results each time
Fix: Add more constraints, use temperature controls (if available),
provide examples

Before: "Write a headline."
After: "Write a headline following this exact formula:
[Number] + [Adjective] + [Noun] + [Benefit]. Like:
'5 Simple Systems That Doubled My Output'.
My topic: [topic]."
```

### The Debugging Checklist

When a prompt isn't working, check:

- [ ] Is the context sufficient?
- [ ] Is the task crystal clear?
- [ ] Is the format specified?
- [ ] Are there conflicting instructions?
- [ ] Would examples help?
- [ ] Am I asking for too much in one prompt?
- [ ] Would breaking into steps help?
- [ ] Did I specify what NOT to do?

### Exercise 2.4: Prompt Debugging

Take a prompt you've used that didn't work well:

Original prompt: ________________
What went wrong: ________________
Diagnosis (which of the 5 problems): ________________
Improved prompt: ________________

# MODULE 3: Workflow Automation
## Connecting AI to Your Daily Operations

### Learning Objectives
- Identify automation opportunities in your workflow
- Build AI-powered automations using no-code tools
- Create human-in-the-loop systems for quality control
- Design scalable content and task pipelines

---

## Lesson 3.1: The Automation Mindset

### Finding Automation Opportunities

**The RARA Framework:**
- **R**epetitive: Does it happen frequently?
- **A**utomatable: Can clear rules govern it?
- **R**obust: Can you handle occasional errors?
- **A**ctionable: Will automation actually be used?

### Task Categories for AI Automation

**High Potential (Start here):**
- Email responses (templates + personalization)
- Data entry from unstructured sources
- Content summarization
- Research compilation
- Report generation
- Meeting notes processing

**Medium Potential (Phase two):**
- Social media content
- Customer support triage
- Document analysis
- Competitive monitoring
- Lead qualification

**Low Potential (Proceed with caution):**
- Creative strategy
- Negotiation
- Relationship-dependent communication
- High-stakes decisions

### The 5-Minute Rule

If a task takes less than 5 minutes:
- Automate it only if it happens 10+ times per week
- Otherwise, just do it (automation overhead exceeds value)

If a task takes more than 5 minutes:
- Calculate: (time × frequency × 4 weeks)
- If >2 hours/month, explore automation

### Exercise 3.1: Automation Audit

List your 10 most repetitive tasks:

| Task | Time/Instance | Frequency/Week | Monthly Hours | RARA Score |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 1.   |               |                |               |            |
| 2.   |               |                |               |            |
| ... |               |                |               |            |

Identify your top 3 automation candidates.

## Lesson 3.4: Human-in-the-Loop Design

### Why HITL Matters

Pure automation is tempting but dangerous:
- AI makes mistakes (hallucinations, tone-deaf responses)
- Automation at scale amplifies errors at scale
- Trust with customers/colleagues is fragile

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) keeps you in control while capturing efficiency.

### HITL Pattern 1: Approve Before Send

```
AI generates → Human reviews → Approved: Send / Rejected: Revise

Example: Customer support drafts
- AI: Drafts response
- Slack notification: "Draft ready for review"
- Human: Approves or edits
- System: Sends (or sends edited version)
```

### HITL Pattern 2: Batch Review

```
AI processes throughout day → End of day batch review

Example: Social media queue
- AI: Generates daily posts throughout day
- You: Review all at once (10 min daily)
- Approved posts: Queue for publishing
- Rejected: Note for prompt improvement
```

### HITL Pattern 3: Exception Handling

```
AI handles standard cases → Flags exceptions for human

Example: Lead qualification
- AI: Scores leads, routes standard ones
- If score unclear or VIP detected: Flag for human
- Human: Reviews flagged leads only
```

### HITL Pattern 4: Sampling

```
AI processes all → Human randomly samples for quality

Example: Data processing
- AI: Processes 1000 entries
- System: Randomly flags 5% for review
- Human: Reviews samples
- If errors found: Investigate and fix process
```

### Exercise 3.4: Add HITL to Your Automation

Take your automation from Exercise 3.2:

Current flow: ________________

Add HITL checkpoint:
- Where: ________________
- Review method: ________________
- Approval action: ________________
- Rejection action: ________________

---

## Lesson 3.5: Measuring Automation ROI

### The ROI Formula

```
Monthly ROI = (Time Saved × Hourly Value) - (Tool Costs + Maintenance Time)

Example:
- Time saved: 10 hours/month
- Hourly value: $50
- Tool cost: $30/month
- Maintenance: 1 hour/month ($50)

ROI = (10 × $50) - ($30 + $50) = $500 - $80 = $420/month
```

### What to Track

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Time saved per task
- Tasks processed per hour
- Error rate (AI vs. human baseline)

**Quality Metrics:**
- Output acceptance rate (% approved first try)
- Customer satisfaction (if customer-facing)
- Error catch rate (HITL effectiveness)

**System Metrics:**
- Automation uptime
- Cost per processed item
- Maintenance hours

### Automation Health Dashboard

Create a simple tracker:

| Automation | Tasks/Week | Time Saved | Error Rate | Cost | ROI |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------|-----|
| Email summarizer | 50 | 2 hrs | 2% | $5 | +$95 |
| Content ideas | 20 | 1 hr | 10% | $3 | +$47 |

### When to Kill an Automation

Stop automating when:
- Error rate exceeds 20%
- More time fixing than it saves
- Requirements have changed
- Better tool available (rebuild vs. maintain)

### Exercise 3.5: ROI Tracking Setup

For your automation:

**Efficiency tracking:**
- Before automation: _____ minutes per task
- After automation: _____ minutes per task
- Tasks per week: _____
- Monthly time savings: _____ hours

**Quality tracking:**
- Acceptance rate target: _____%
- Error rate threshold: _____%

**Monthly ROI projection:** $_____

## Pushing the Boundaries of AI Productivity

### Learning Objectives
- Apply multi-model strategies for complex tasks
- Use AI for high-level thinking and strategy
- Build AI-assisted research systems
- Leverage AI for learning and skill development

---

## Lesson 4.1: Multi-Model Strategies

### Why Use Multiple Models?

Different AI models have different strengths:
- **Claude**: Nuanced writing, long documents, careful reasoning
- **GPT-4**: Versatile, strong coding, plugin ecosystem
- **Perplexity**: Research with citations, current information
- **Gemini**: Google integration, multimodal

### Strategy 1: Specialist Routing

Route tasks to the best model:
```
Writing task → Claude
Coding task → GPT-4 + Copilot
Research task → Perplexity
Quick question → Gemini (if in Google ecosystem)
```

### Strategy 2: Generation + Critique

Use one model to generate, another to critique:
```
1. Claude: Write blog post
2. GPT-4: "Review this blog post. Identify weaknesses,
   factual claims to verify, and areas lacking depth."
3. Claude: Revise based on critique
```

### Strategy 3: Parallel Perspectives

Get multiple takes, then synthesize:
```
1. Send same question to Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini
2. Compare responses for:
   - Points of agreement (high confidence)
   - Points of disagreement (investigate further)
   - Unique insights from each
3. Synthesize best elements
```

### Strategy 4: Research → Analysis → Writing

Use each model for its strength:
```
1. Perplexity: Research with sources
2. Claude: Analyze and identify insights
3. GPT-4: Draft outline with plugins for data
4. Claude: Write final piece with research integrated
```

### Exercise 4.1: Multi-Model Workflow

Design a multi-model workflow for a complex task you face:

Task: ________________

Model 1 (________________):
Role: ________________

Model 2 (________________):
Role: ________________

Model 3 (________________):
Role: ________________

How they connect: ________________

## Lesson 4.2: AI for Strategic Thinking

### The Thinking Partner Framework

Use AI as a thinking partner, not just a task executor:

**Role 1: The Questioner**
```
"I'm considering [decision]. Ask me 10 probing questions
that will help me think through this more thoroughly.
Focus on what I might not be considering."
```

**Role 2: The Devil's Advocate**
```
"I believe [position]. Argue against this position as
compellingly as possible. Don't hold back - I need to
stress-test this thinking."
```

**Role 3: The Synthesizer**
```
"Here are multiple perspectives on [issue]:
[Perspective 1]
[Perspective 2]
[Perspective 3]

Synthesize these into a coherent framework that
accounts for their insights while resolving tensions."
```

**Role 4: The Pre-Mortem Analyst**
```
"I'm about to [action]. Imagine it's one year later and
this has failed completely. Write a detailed analysis
of what went wrong. Be specific and creative about
failure modes I'm not seeing."
```

**Role 5: The Second-Order Thinker**
```
"If I [action], what are the second and third-order
effects? What might happen as a result of those effects?
Map out the cascade of consequences."
```

### Strategic Planning with AI

**Annual planning session:**
```
1. "Review these goals from last year: [goals].
   Assess what went well, what didn't, and why."

2. "Given these learnings and these constraints [list],
   what should my priorities be for this year?
   Challenge conventional thinking."

3. "For each priority, what's the smallest meaningful
   first step I could take this week?"

4. "What's missing from this plan? What would make
   it 10x more ambitious? What would make it fail-proof?"
```

### Decision Frameworks

**Decision analysis prompt:**
```
"I need to decide between [Option A] and [Option B].

Criteria that matter to me:
- [Criterion 1]: weight [%]
- [Criterion 2]: weight [%]
- [Criterion 3]: weight [%]

For each option, score it 1-10 on each criterion.
Then calculate weighted scores. Finally, note any
factors that this framework might miss."
```

### Exercise 4.2: Strategic Session

Conduct a strategic thinking session with AI:

1. Choose a significant decision or plan
2. Use at least 3 of the "Thinking Partner" roles
3. Document insights that you wouldn't have reached alone

Decision/Plan: ________________
Key insights gained: ________________

## Lesson 4.4: AI-Accelerated Learning

### The Learning Loop

1. **Assess**: Where am I now?
2. **Plan**: What's the fastest path to competence?
3. **Learn**: Consume information efficiently
4. **Apply**: Practice with feedback
5. **Reflect**: What's working, what isn't?

AI accelerates each stage.

### Stage 1: Assessment

```
"I want to learn [skill]. I'll describe my current level:
[description]

Assess me:
- What level am I (beginner/intermediate/advanced)?
- What foundational gaps might I have?
- What strengths can I build on?
- What's my likely learning edge (just beyond current ability)?"
```

### Stage 2: Curriculum Design

```
"Design a learning path for [skill] that:
- Starts from [my current level]
- Gets me to [target level] in [timeframe]
- Focuses on [practical application/theory/both]
- Uses [time per day/week] I have available
- Prioritizes [my learning style: videos/reading/doing]

Include milestones to track progress."
```

### Stage 3: Efficient Learning

**Summarize sources:**
```
"Summarize [book/course/article] with focus on:
- Core concepts I must understand
- Practical techniques I can apply immediately
- What the author would say to someone at my level"
```

**Generate examples:**
```
"I'm learning [concept]. Generate:
- 3 simple examples that illustrate the basics
- 3 complex examples that show nuance
- 3 counter-examples (when it doesn't apply)
- A memorable analogy"
```

### Stage 4: Practice with Feedback

```
"I'm going to practice [skill].
1. Give me a challenge appropriate for my level
2. After I attempt it, provide detailed feedback
3. Suggest specific improvements
4. Give me a slightly harder challenge"
```

**Code review learning:**
```
"Review this code as a senior developer would:
- Point out what I did well
- Identify mistakes and explain why they're problematic
- Suggest improvements with explanations
- Rate my current level and suggest next skill to work on

Code: [paste]"
```

### Stage 5: Reflection

```
"This week I practiced [skill]. Here's what happened:
- What I tried: [description]
- What worked: [description]
- What was hard: [description]

Help me reflect:
- What patterns do you see in my struggles?
- What should I focus on next?
- Am I approaching this correctly?"
```

## Lesson 4.5: Working with Long Documents

### Long Context Strategies

Modern AI can handle extensive documents:
- Claude: 100K+ tokens (roughly a novel)
- GPT-4: 128K tokens
- Gemini: 1M+ tokens

### Strategy 1: Complete Document Upload

For documents within context limits:
```
"I'm sharing a complete document. First, read it entirely.
Then: [specific questions or tasks]"
```

### Strategy 2: Chunked Processing

For documents exceeding limits:
```
Chunk 1: "I'm sharing a document in parts. This is part 1 of 5.
Read and note key points. I'll share more."

Chunk 2-4: "Part 2 of 5. Continue noting key points."

Chunk 5: "Final part. Now, with the full document:
[comprehensive question/task]"
```

### Strategy 3: Summary Layering

Build understanding iteratively:
```
Pass 1: "Summarize this document in 500 words."
Pass 2: "Now go deeper on [section]. Provide detail."
Pass 3: "Connect [section A] with [section B]. What's the relationship?"
Pass 4: "[Specific question]"
```

### Strategy 4: Question-Driven Reading

```
"I'm sharing a [document type]. I need to answer:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

Read with these questions in mind and provide
focused answers with page/section references."
```

### Document Types and Approaches

**Contracts/Legal:**
```
"Review this contract. Identify:
1. Key obligations for each party
2. Risky clauses I should negotiate
3. Missing protections I should request
4. Unusual terms that need explanation"
```

**Research Papers:**
```
"Read this academic paper. Provide:
1. Plain-English summary of findings
2. Methodology strengths and weaknesses
3. Practical implications
4. How it relates to [my specific interest]"
```

**Technical Documentation:**
```
"I'm reading [technical docs]. Help me:
1. Understand the core concepts
2. Identify the 20% I need to know for my use case
3. Create a quick-reference of key commands/methods
4. Note common pitfalls mentioned"
