suspense around the pivotal decisions.

OUTCOME: We pivoted our product focus, landed 3 enterprise clients
in 4 weeks, and hit profitability within 6 months.

REFLECTION: Key lessons about focus, customer development, and
the psychology of scarcity. Be vulnerable about mistakes.

YOU (READER): Other founders who might be in similar situations.
They should feel hope but also get tactical takeaways. Don't
make it feel like humble-bragging survivorship bias.
```

- Chrome 120, also reproduced in Firefox
- Development and production builds

BEHAVIOR:
- Expected: Smooth navigation with product data loading
- Actual: White screen, console error "Cannot read properties
  of undefined (reading 'map')"
- Reproduces 100% of the time
- Started after adding Redux Toolkit

UNDERLYING:
- Suspect state not persisting during navigation
- Or async data fetch completing after unmount

it reliably. They feel helpless and manipulated.

CHANGE: Our extension uses detection algorithms to flag or hide
AI-generated posts, giving users control over their information diet.

HOOK: Target techno-optimists who love AI but hate seeing it
weaponized for engagement farming. Position as pro-AI, anti-slop.
Not Luddite positioning.

# Section 5: Advanced Chaining Techniques

## Chain Type 1: Funnel Chain

Start broad, then narrow progressively.

```
PROMPT 1: "List all possible marketing channels for a B2B SaaS product."

PROMPT 2: "From those channels, which are most effective for
products with deal sizes of $10K-50K annual contracts?"

PROMPT 3: "For [selected channels], what specific tactics work
best in 2024 with a $20K monthly budget?"

PROMPT 4: "Create a detailed implementation plan for [top 2 tactics]."
```

## Chain Type 2: Expert Panel Chain

Get multiple perspectives, then synthesize.

```
PROMPT 1: "As a growth marketer, evaluate this landing page."

PROMPT 2: "As a UX researcher, evaluate this landing page."

PROMPT 3: "As a conversion copywriter, evaluate this landing page."

PROMPT 4: "Synthesize these three expert perspectives into a
prioritized list of improvements with highest impact first."
```

## Chain Type 3: Devil's Advocate Chain

Build an argument, then stress-test it.

```
PROMPT 1: "Make the strongest case for [position/strategy]."

PROMPT 2: "Now argue against that position. What are the
strongest counterarguments?"

PROMPT 3: "What evidence or conditions would you need to see
to determine which position is correct?"

PROMPT 4: "Given this analysis, what's the most defensible
position and what are its caveats?"
```

## Chain Type 4: Translation Chain

Move ideas across contexts.

```
PROMPT 1: "Explain how Netflix's recommendation algorithm works."

PROMPT 2: "What principles from Netflix's approach could apply
to a B2B sales process?"

PROMPT 3: "Design a lead scoring system for [my company] that
applies these principles."
```

## Chain Type 5: Iterative Refinement Chain

Build and improve systematically.

```
PROMPT 1: "Write a first draft of [content]."

PROMPT 2: "Review this draft. What are its weaknesses?"

PROMPT 3: "Rewrite addressing those weaknesses."

PROMPT 4: "Now optimize for [specific metric: engagement,
clarity, emotional impact, etc.]"

PROMPT 5: "Final polish: check for flow, cut unnecessary words,
strengthen the opening and closing."
```

## Chain Type 6: Context Building Chain

Layer context for complex tasks.

```
PROMPT 1: "Here's information about my company: [details].
Summarize my company's positioning and target market."

PROMPT 2: "Here's information about my competitors: [details].
Analyze our competitive position."

PROMPT 3: "Here's our current challenge: [details]. With all
this context, what are our strategic options?"
```
