## Prompt Engineering Tips

Getting the best results from ChatGPT requires understanding how to structure your prompts effectively.

### The CRAFT Framework

Use this framework for better prompts every time:

- **C**ontext: Give background information
- **R**ole: Define who ChatGPT should be
- **A**ction: Specify exactly what you want
- **F**ormat: Describe the output structure
- **T**one: Set the voice and style

### Key Principles for Better Prompts

**1. Be Specific, Not Vague**

Instead of: "Write about marketing"
Use: "Write a 500-word guide on email marketing for B2B SaaS companies, focusing on welcome sequences that convert free trial users to paid customers."

**2. Provide Examples**

Show ChatGPT what good output looks like. Include a sample of the style, format, or approach you want.

**3. Use Step-by-Step Instructions**

Break complex tasks into numbered steps. This helps ChatGPT process your request systematically.

**4. Iterate and Refine**

Your first prompt rarely produces perfect results. Use follow-up prompts to refine:
- "Make this more conversational"
- "Add specific examples"
- "Shorten this to half the length"
- "Rewrite the introduction with more urgency"

**5. Set Constraints**

Limits actually improve output:
- Word counts
- Format requirements
- Things to avoid
- Specific elements to include

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague** - "Help me with my business" gives ChatGPT nothing to work with
2. **Overloading prompts** - Focus on one task at a time
3. **Forgetting context** - ChatGPT does not know your situation unless you explain it
4. **Not specifying format** - If you want bullet points, say so
5. **Accepting first drafts** - Always refine and iterate

---
